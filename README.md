## üìñ Overview
This project uses **PySpark** to analyze irregularities in global financial transactions by processing the **Big Black Money Dataset**.  
The workflow includes:
- Data preprocessing (cleaning, feature engineering, outlier removal, encoding, normalization).  
- Distributed transformations and DAG visualizations for execution analysis.  
- Machine learning models with **PySpark MLlib** for detecting suspicious transactions.

## üìä Dataset
- **Source:** [Global Black Money Transactions Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/waqi786/global-black-money-transactions-dataset)  
- **Size:** 10,000 rows √ó 14 columns  
- **Key Columns:** Transaction ID, Amount (USD), Countries, Industry, Financial Institution, Risk Score, Shell Companies.  
- **Goal:** Identify irregular transactions linked to money laundering and financial crimes.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Data Processing Pipeline
1. **Convert date ‚Üí timestamp** for temporal analysis.  
2. **Handle missing values** (mean imputation).  
3. **Remove duplicates** (based on Transaction ID).  
4. **Remove outliers** (IQR filtering on Amount).  
5. **Risk categorization** (High/Medium/Low from risk score).  
6. **One-hot encoding** of categorical variables.  
7. **Normalize Amount (USD)** with MinMaxScaler.  
8. **Aggregate transactions per person** (total & count).  
9. **Window functions** to compute rolling averages for trends.

## ü§ñ Machine Learning Models (PySpark MLlib)
- **Naive Bayes** ‚Äì Accuracy: ~92%  
- **Logistic Regression** ‚Äì Accuracy: ~94.9%, Precision/Recall ~94.9%  
- **KNN Classifier** ‚Äì Accuracy: ~92%, F1 ~95.6%  
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** ‚Äì Accuracy: ~92%  
- **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)** ‚Äì Experimental  
- **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)** ‚Äì Accuracy: ~79%, but failed on positive class due to imbalance  

Metrics: **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, Execution Time**

## üìà Results
- **Best Model:** Logistic Regression (Accuracy ~94.9%, balanced Precision/Recall).  
- **KNN** performed well on positives, slightly slower execution.  
- **MLP** underperformed due to class imbalance.  
- **DAG Visualizations** provided insights into Spark‚Äôs execution stages and optimizations.
